            <p>"To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. 
            Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ." - Colossians 1:27-28</p><br/>
            <p>Cross Covenant's Vision is taken from the beginning of Colossians 1:28, "Him we proclaim ..."</p><br/>
            <p>Life is about God, revealed to us in Jesus Christ. As individuals and as the church, in all things we worship HIM. Life is designed to be lived as a part of a spiritual community. WE were meant to worship him together. Life with him is so vitally important that we long to share our faith. We will always look for ways to PROCLAIM the life that Jesus offers.</p><br/>
            <p>HIM: Jesus is the leader of his people, and he is the main character in the story of the church.  The good news recorded in the Bible is all about Jesus--who he is, what he has done, and what he is doing.  Our preaching and worship are centered on him, and all our goals are focused on enjoying him and telling each other and the world about the greatness of Christ, the one who died and rose again to give us abundant life.</p><br/>
            <p>WE:God has called together a community of people called the church.  He has designed his people to live not only in relationship with him, but also in connection with this group of other Christians.  In fact, it is only when regularly interacting with the community of the local church that we can live our life with God in Christ Jesus to the fullest.  It is within the church that God tangibly shows us his grace and teaches us to follow him together.</p><br/>
            <p>PROCLAIM: When we have deeply known his love for us, we long to share the good news about Jesus with others.  God calls us together so that we can be equipped to share this good news with one another as we learn from the teaching and community of the church.  He then sends us back out to proclaim the good news to our neighbors in Charlotte, and to those in every corner of the globe who need to hear of Jesus' greatness.</p>

            <p>As a member of the Presbyterian Church in America, Cross Covenant Chinese Church upholds the key values of the PCA:</p><br/>
            <ul>
                <li>The Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and practice.</li>
                <li>There is one God, eternal and self-existing in three persons (Father, Son and Holy Spirit) who are to be equally loved, honored, and adored.</li>
                <li> All mankind participated in Adam’s fall from his original sinless state and is thus lost in sin and totally helpless.</li>
                <li>The Sovereign God, for no other reason than His own unfathomable love and mercy, has chosen lost sinners from every nation to be redeemed by the quickening power of the Holy Spirit and through the atoning death and resurrection of His son, Jesus Christ.</li>
                <li> Those sinners whom the Spirit quickens come to believe in Christ as Savior by the Word of God, are born again, become sons of God, and will persevere to the end.</li>
                <li>Justification is by faith, and through it the undeserving sinner is clothed with the righteousness of Christ.</li>
                <li>The goal of God’s salvation in the life of the Christian is holiness, good works, and service for the glory of God.</li>
                <li>At death the Christian’s soul passes immediately into the presence of God, and the unbeliever’s soul is eternally separated from God unto condemnation.</li>
                <li>Baptism is a sign of God’s covenant and is properly administered to children of believers in their infancy, as well as to those who come as adults to trust in Christ.</li>
                <li>Jesus Christ will return to earth, visibly and bodily, at a time when He is not expected, to consummate history and the eternal plan of God.</li>
                <li>The Gospel of God’s salvation in Jesus Christ must be published to all the world as a witness before Jesus Christ returns.</li>

            <p>God and Creation: We believe that God has made all things for his glory, including and especially, humanity.  He is the Almighty God and the Creator, ruling over all the things that he has made, and he has revealed himself as one God in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. List Romans 11:36 and Jeremiah 10:12</p><br/>
            <p>The Fall: We believe that the world is broken because of sin. Man is sinful and is therefore separated from God. We are all born sinful and everything is tainted by that sin. LIst Romans 5:12</p><br/>
            <p>Jesus and Redemption: We believe that Jesus Christ was sent so that we can know God. He was and is fully God and fully man. He came to this world to die as a substitute, paying for our sin. He lived the perfect life, free from sin, and died a criminal’s death. After three days, he rose again from the dead, and he still lives today. True life is found in following Jesus and living for him. List John 3:16 and Col. 1:19-20</p><br/>
            <p>The Holy Spirit and Sanctification: We believe that Jesus sent the Holy Spirit to live in the hearts of believers, empowering us for obedience and ministry. List John 15:26</p><br/>
            <p>Scripture: We believe that the Bible is inspired by God, completely true and without error, and the ultimate authority for faith and practice. The Bible is how we understand God, ourselves, and all of life. With this in mind, we highly value preaching in the worship service, along with spending time together reading and studying the Bible. List 2 Tim. 3:16 and Romans 10:17</p><br/>
            <p>The Church and Sacraments: We believe that God is calling people into his family, called the Church, and that local churches are where he calls us to grow, learn, serve, worship, and minister. Our church is just one expression of the universal Church, which is comprised of all those churches throughout the world that profess the true gospel of Jesus Christ. We believe that in church Jesus has called us to preach, to pray, to sing, and to participate in the sacraments. Sacraments are visible representations of the good news about Jesus. The two sacraments he gives us are Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. List 1 cor. 11:25-26, Col. 3:15-16</p><br/>
            <p>Mission: We believe that God has a mission for the Church, commonly referred to as the Great Commission, where we are to go into the whole world sharing good news, baptizing, and teaching so that people from every tribe, tongue, and nation will continue to come into God’s family. Matt. 28:18-20</p><br/>
            <p>Christ's Return: We believe that Jesus is going to return to make all things new, bringing about full justice and righteousness as he rules and reigns in the new heavens and the new earth for all eternity. Rev. 21:1-7</p>
